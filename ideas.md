IDEAS
======================
* Model the Mexican Drug War between different gangs using the Inter-Group Violence Model from Epstein 2002
  and compare it with the statistics given in 'https://github.com/diegovalle/Homicide-MX-Drug-War'.
  Maybe expand it introducing civilians which don't kill but only get killed.
